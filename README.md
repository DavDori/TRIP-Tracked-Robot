## Features
- **Open-Source Software**: Leverage open-source libraries and frameworks for control, navigation, and communication.
- **ROS2 Integration**: Utilize ROS2 for seamless communication, control, and coordination of your robot's components.
- **Arduino Interface**: Interface with sensors and actuators using Arduino microcontrollers, providing real-time control and feedback.
- **Testing Environment**: We plan to utilize the platform for testing various algorithms, control strategies, and sensor integrations in real-world scenarios.
- **Low Budget**: as this project is self-founded we aim to explore low cost hardware.
